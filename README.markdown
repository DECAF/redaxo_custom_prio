Addon: [CustomPrio](http://www.redaxo.de/180-0-addon-details.html?addon_id=840 "http://www.redaxo.de/180-0-addon-details.html?addon_id=840")

Description
-----------

Changes the priority of new articles or categories. Instead of 100 as the default value you can set your own default priorities.

Configuration is stored in an ini-File. You can set the category-ID in which the custom priority for new articles and categories are overridden and if the priority should be inherited.

After installation of the addon new articles will get the priority of 2, categories are unchanged at 100.

The default priority is set with jQuery, so Javascript has to be activated on the client side.
